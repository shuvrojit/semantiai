# React TypeScript Browser Extension - Advanced Tab Manager

This repository contains a browser extension built with React and TypeScript that provides powerful tab management capabilities. The extension helps users efficiently organize, search, and manage their browser tabs with a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Tab Management
- View and manage all open tabs in a clean, organized interface
- Search functionality to quickly find specific tabs
- Close individual tabs or all tabs at once
- Pin/unpin tabs for easy access
- Status indicators for active and pinned tabs

### Session Management
- Save current browsing sessions
- Restore previous sessions
- Create bookmarks of all open tabs
- Organize tabs into folders

### Tab Content Analysis
- Generate summaries of tab content
- Get detailed overviews of pages
- View page information and metadata
- Save tab content for later reference

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or above recommended)
- npm (v9 or above recommended)
- A modern web browser that supports installing extensions in development mode (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

The following scripts are available:

- **dev**: Starts the development server using Vite.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **build**: Runs TypeScript type checking (tsc -b) and bundles the app for production using Vite.
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **lint**: Lints the source files using ESLint.
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **preview**: Previews the production build locally.
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## Development

To launch a development server and continuously rebuild on changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your app at a local development URL (usually http://localhost:3000 by default), allowing you to test the browser extension's UI.

## Building the Extension

When ready to create a production build of the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code, bundles it with Vite, and outputs production-ready files in the dist folder.

## Loading the Extension

### Chrome
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder generated by the build
4. The extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar

### Firefox
1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
2. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Navigate to your project's `dist` folder and select the `manifest.json` file
