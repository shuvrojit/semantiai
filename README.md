# React TypeScript Browser Extension

This repository contains a React application written in TypeScript for use as a browser extension. Follow the instructions below to set up, develop, and build the project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or above recommended)
- npm (v9 or above recommended)
- A modern web browser that supports installing extensions in development mode (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

In the project’s package.json, the following scripts are available:

- **dev**: Starts the development server using Vite.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **build**: Runs TypeScript type checking (tsc -b) and bundles the app for production using Vite.
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **lint**: Lints the source files using ESLint.
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **preview**: Previews the production build locally.
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## Development

To launch a development server and continuously rebuild on changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your app at a local development URL (usually http://localhost:5173 by default), allowing you to test the browser extension’s UI.

## Building the Extension

When ready to create a production build of the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code, bundles it with Vite, and outputs production-ready files (typically in the dist folder). You can then load these files into your browser of choice in developer/extension mode.

## Loading the Extension (Chrome Example)

1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the dist folder generated by the build.
4. The extension should now appear in Chrome’s extension panel.

## Additional Notes

- If using Firefox or another browser, follow that browser’s guidelines for loading unpacked or temporary extensions.
- Ensure your **manifest.json** file matches the required format for a browser extension in your target browser(s).
